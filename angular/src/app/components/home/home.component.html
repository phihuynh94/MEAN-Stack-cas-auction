                        <h3>1. How do I Sign Up?</h3>
                        <p>In order to participate in our auctions you must first <a routerLink="/user/signup">Sign Up</a>. The sign up form will require you to create an ALIAS which is a 3 letter phrase
                        we will use to identify items that you upload and items that you've won in the auction. This alias is assigned uniquely to you and it is encouraged you use your
                        3 initials. An example name and alias pair: If your name is "John Michael Smith" your alias would be "JMS". After signing up, you can participate in auctions, upload items, and
                        personalize your account.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>2. How do I Sell items in the CAS auction?</h3>
                        <p>To sell at our auctions please upload appropriate items in order to avoid having your items be rejected. Please have a title, image, and description for each of your items.<br />
                        After signing in, select an auction and press "Participate". Now you are added to the auction. After joining, click "Sell Item". You can now upload your items for other participants to bid on OR you can choose
                      to add your item as a quick sale item. Quick Sale items are not used in the auction, rather they are sold direct to participants at a set price.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>3. How do I checkout and pay for my items?</h3>
                        <p>First sign in to our dashboard. After an auction has completed, your "Cart" will be updated with the items you've won. Once in the dashboard, press "Cart". Now you can see a list of the items you've won and also <br />

                        <p>In our system we will know which items were sold and which were not. When you upload your items to the auction they are tied to your unique 3 character alias. We can see the specific items marked as unsold using your Alias. We will return the items to the participants who did not have their item sold before they leave the auction.<br />
                        After the auction completes, please speak to a CAS staff memeber directly and we will return your item to you.</p>

                        <h3>5. How will CAS Auction pay me for the products I've sold?</h3>
                        <p>CAS Auction charges a small $1 fee per item added to the auction. After this we use 20% of the "Final Price" to continue funding our monthly auctions and community gathering and provide 80% of the final price to the original seller of the item. This structure allows our auctions
                          to stay sustainable and continuous. After the auction completes, we mail a check to the particants whom we owe the money to directly so they can then deposit their earnings at their bank.
